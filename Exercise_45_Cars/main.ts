// Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. 
// The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. 
// It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. 
// Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. 
// Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.
